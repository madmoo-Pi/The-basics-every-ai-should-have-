# Omnius AI System - Ethical Parallel AI Architecture

Welcome to the **Omnius AI System** project‚Äîa modular, ethical, and parallel AI architecture inspired by Asimov's Laws, designed for advanced, safe, and creative artificial intelligence applications.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Omnius AI is an extensible Python codebase that demonstrates a robust, ethical, parallel AI system. It features:
- A **Dual-Redundant Ethical Core** enforcing Asimov's Laws and enhanced humanitarian principles.
- Four specialized AI subsystems operating in parallel:
  - **Logic AI** (deductive, inductive, and probabilistic reasoning)
  - **Creative AI** (innovative and lateral thinking)
  - **Audio/Visual AI** (multimodal processing and generation)
  - **Robotics AI** (motion planning, manipulation, and continuous ethical checks)
- **Neuroevolution Emulator** for adaptive improvement of AI subsystems.
- Dynamic **Resource Management** for optimal system performance and hardware safety.
- **Self-Repair System** for fault-tolerant, self-healing AI operation.

## üì¶ Core Components

### 1. Ethical Core

- Enforces Asimov‚Äôs Laws
- Enhanced humanitarian and non-replicating constraints
- Dual-redundant with cryptographic integrity checks
- Ethical gate for all subsystem actions

### 2. AI Strings

- **LogicAI**: Symbolic/probabilistic logic, learning, feedback adaptation
- **CreativeAI**: Divergent/convergent thinking, lateral idea generation
- **AudioVisualAI**: Handles image/audio input/output, privacy/cultural filters
- **RoboticsAI**: Plans and executes physical actions, environmental awareness

### 3. Neuroevolution Emulator

- Evolves and mutates AI subsystems for optimal performance
- Supports elitism, mutation, and crossover

### 4. Resource Manager

- Monitors and manages CPU, memory, disk, GPU, network, and environmental factors
- Emergency throttling to prevent system damage

### 5. Self-Repair System

- Monitors AI health
- Automatic recovery and knowledge transfer between AI strings

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: `psutil`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`

```bash
pip install psutil numpy opencv-python
```

### Running the System

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/madmoo-Pi/The-basics-every-ai-should-have-.git
    cd The-basics-every-ai-should-have-
    ```
2. Run the main integration entry point:
    ```bash
    python omnius_system.py
    ```

---

## üß© Extending the System

- Implement the `pass` sections in each AI string for full functionality.
- Integrate your own subsystems or sensors as needed.
- Adapt the ethical core or add new ethical constraints as the use case requires.
